# Ikol recruitment taks - Backend

How to run:

## Prerequisites

- PHP installation
- A local development environment (confirmed to work with XAMPP, I do not reccommend PHP CLI built-in server due to CORS issues)

### Running in XAMPP

If you choose to run this code in XAMPP, first install it on your system (https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html). After the installation is finished copy this folder and put inside the /htdocs directory inside your XAMPP directory, so that the path is like so:

```sh
path/to/xampp/htdocs/ikol-task-backend
```

After that run XAMPP and start an Apache server. Now the endpoint used by the frontend app will be exposed and resdy to use.
